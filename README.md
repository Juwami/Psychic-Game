# Psychic-Game

## Overview
Game created using HTML and JavaScript.


## How the Game Works
The game starts by choosing a random letter of the alphabet. The letter is hidden and the user must use keystrokes to guess the hidden letter. Each incorrectly letter will drop the number of remaining guess by one. When all guesses have been used up, the user will lose. Each guess will be recorded under 'Your guesses so far: ' to prevent the user from typing in the same key multiple times. If the user is able to guess the winning number, it will result in a win and the game will start again. Wins and Losses will increment upon meeting one of the win/loss conditions.
